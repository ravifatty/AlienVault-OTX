# AlienVault-OTX
Script uses AlienVault OTX v2 API, written in python3. Fast and easy way to extract info from AlienVault.
# Usage
Before using script put your API key inside the script and download OTXv2 by pip.
This is just simple script to sort out out raw output from
AlienVault API which is horrible to read.
# Help
use alien.py - h to get options
